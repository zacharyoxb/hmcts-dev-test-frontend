# HMCTS Dev Test Frontend
This will be the frontend for the brand new HMCTS case management system. As a potential candidate we are leaving
this in your hands. Please refer to the brief for the complete list of tasks! Complete as much as you can and be
as creative as you want.

To begin with, you should be able to run this by running:
1) `yarn install`
2) `yarn webpack`
3) `yarn start:dev` or navigate to package.json and run the script manually

CANDIDATE NOTES: 
No changes needed for this one, I just made changes to the home njk and typescript files.
